        Consider f to be a subset of A x B such that for all x in A, (x, n) and (x, m) implies that n = m, <br>
        then f is a function from set A to set B,
        and denoted as f: A -> B

        More generally, consider a subset of A x B, where A and B are any arbitrary sets,
        then f is a relation on A x B.

        Equivalence relation gives rise to a partition, and vice versa
